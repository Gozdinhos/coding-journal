# MY CODING JOURNEY

> Mischief managed! :herb:

2. DAY

"I continued to work with Wes Bos's projects, today's project was building a clock . Since I had developed a tiny digital clock before, I did not have a lot of effort and difficulty with this project today. I tried writing proper commit messages to my repos, I read a few more articles from our slack goodreads group. ALso i created this journal today. That's all :clock5:"

1. DAY

"First I downloaded Wes Bosâ€™s code, then coded along first project with him. Data-key was a new thing for me, I have never used before, but I quite liked it. Then I decided to change the style a little bit (just background image and colors). Also I have learned how to share my repo with you. Additionally, today I wrote my first README.md, I dont know why but I have never used before. But after today, I have decided to write README docs to my all repos and signature them like a one true Potterhead :rocket:"
