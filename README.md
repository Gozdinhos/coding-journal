Here are the highlights what i have used today with sorting band names project.

reduce();
Array.from();

--> That was the most important part.
const seconds = timeNodes
.map(node => node.dataset.time)
.map(timeCode => {
const [mins, secs] = timeCode.split(':').map(parseFloat);
return (mins \* 60) + secs;
})
.reduce((total, vidSeconds) => total + vidSeconds);

14. DAY

Here are the highlights what i have used today with sorting band names project.

replace();
trim();
innerHTML with '<li></li>'
sorting function.

13. DAY

Today i have finished 2 projects. (15-16) Learned about local storage and also searched about session storage and cookies, too. Session storage data is available as long as browser tab is open but localstorage data is available even after browser is closed. I accidently clear all my local storage and learned very well what is it for when i try to log in to all my accounts again. :) Also the tricky math part is the my favorite part of the mouse shadow project.

12.DAY

Copying and trying to change primitive variables, arrays, objects. Practicing with concat(); spread operator, object.assign etc.

11.DAY

I built a project with WesBos that allows the images to slide when scrolling.

10.DAY

I worked on key sequence detection project today and working on it was fun. Konami code is also fun, i think. I manipulated wesbos's konami code to "mischiefmanaged". When i type this secret word, unicorns appear. I try to work on also codewars for a few days, and today my coding style made me proud.

9.DAY

Today's project is a tough one for me. I worked with html5 and made a video player. At the end of the coding along, i tried to add a functional fullscreen button and styled it.

8.DAY

I learn how i can check the checkboxes when i m holding shift. I used shiftkey and manipulate a flag variable to do this. This project gives me an opinion if i try to build a mailbox something etc.

7. DAY

I learn html5 canvas today. Canvas itself, most of the properties and methods are totally new for me. So it was a quite useful project. Additionally, i try to get familiar dev tools and from now on console.table(), console.warn(), console.error() are my favorites.

6. DAY

I got familiar with fetch(), then() and regexp() with Type Ahead Project and regexp is totally new for me, but i like it and have some new ideas about it! Also with Array Cardio 2, i learn new array methods, like some(), every(), findIndex() etc.

5.DAY

I code along with WesBos to build flex panels. Every project teaches me different coding techniques and perspective. I have to say that this course is really inspiring and useful. :dizzy:

4.DAY

I have got familiar with array methods like reduce, map, filter and refreshed my git practices. Also i have decided to move my all js30 projects in a single repo and today i did it. That's all! :orange_heart:

3.DAY

Today i have learned css variables usage, and also day by day i have seen different html tags which are very interesting for me. Today i have seen label tag. I have build a project with WesBos that let you manipulate some values of an image. I decided to move my mini projects to a single repo and keep searching. That's all for today :milky_way:

2.DAY

I continued to work with Wes Bos's projects, today's project was building a clock . Since I had developed a tiny digital clock before, I did not have a lot of effort and difficulty with this project today. I tried writing proper commit messages to my repos, I read a few more articles from our slack goodreads group. ALso i created this journal today. That's all :clock5:

1.DAY

First I downloaded Wes Bosâ€™s code, then coded along first project with him. Data-key was a new thing for me, I have never used before, but I quite liked it. Then I decided to change the style a little bit (just background image and colors). Also I have learned how to share my repo with you. Additionally, today I wrote my first README.md, I dont know why but I have never used before. But after today, I have decided to write README docs to my all repos and signature them like a one true Potterhead :rocket:
